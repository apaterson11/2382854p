# 17/11/21

## Agenda
- Talk about streams
- Talk about these bytes translation issues that are giving me errors

## Notes

### Buffer sizes etc
- Need to make sure that the size of the data I am sending is the same as the buffer etc
- Am what I am expecting to send (line 157) the same as what I actually am (line 169)
- Very common issue that catches a lot of people out

### Byte bugs
- Google endianness related bugs 
- Is one side interpreting it as big endian and the other little endian?

## Plan for next week
- Same plan as last:
    - Try and get it running in the first place well, streams and datagrams
    - Watch IETF youtube video
    - Benchmarking Python implementation is a good idea
    - Try and get script running with quiche server  
        - If we get write HTTP library on top of QUIC in rust, shouldn't be too bad
        - Port over the python code for WebTransport stuff into Rust in Quiche
