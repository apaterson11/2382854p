# Meeting 12 - 02.02.22

## Agenda
- What I've been doing: network is now set up, hosts can connect to each other so nearly ready to go - only issue is with cameras and chrome sessions.
    - Look into connecting mininet to the Internet so it can approve the certificates or see if the actual certificate is the issue.
    - Can we configure chrome to trust a self-signed certificate?

### Ethics form
- How does Colin sign it
- But yeah all good
- Just send it to Colin

### Tests
- Show Colin all the tests, ask for feedback - is this useful, how should I prioritise them, am I missing any obvious ones, do I need less/more. 
- Can we lose one packet at a particular point and see how that affects the builds?
    - Datagrams, temporary glitch, latency the same
    - Streams one will retransmit but then latency will increase as it retransmits


## Plan for next week
- Run the tests
- Update all those diagrams
