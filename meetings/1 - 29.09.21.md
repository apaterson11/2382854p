## Agenda
- Written status reports in advance of a meeting? What Iâ€™ve done over the past week
- Any other etiquette? Email, teams etc.?
- Project aims
- Project motivation
    - Is this good enough?
    - Has been done but not for video streaming

## Notes
### What the project could be:
- Could be purely measurement thing, see how applications work with TCP, QUIC
    - Plug in wifi/5G simulator, vary network quality, see how they behave
- Could be something that looks at quic for video streaming, conferencing (livestreaming vs non-live media)
    - Maybe take conferencing system e.g. gstream and add in a quic implementation
    - Could take existing quic library, try to start from scratch, bolt some video conferencing on top
    - Take some web based stuff, Web Transport, lets javascript open QUIC connections to arbitrary connections, video capture in browser
        - Can write entirely in JavaScript
- Could maybe take existing quic library, existing video codec, bolt them together with video capture thing on mac and build own video streaming/conferencing tool
    - Maybe could improve QUIC but just doing it at all is a useful project

### General
- Have a look at Web Transport
