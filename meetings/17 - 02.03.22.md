# Meeting 17 - 02.03.22

### diss draft
- switch over to numeric style
- background, have an introductory para before going in to address each background point
    - introduce things here that we will talk about later
    - compare QUIC to TCP/UDP more - why should we care about it?

### webrtc connection
- actual connection of browser to server is likely TCP
    - basically whatever HTTP version the server is running
    - The ICE stuff can potentially take a while, no way to tell, just the way it works
    - designed to work, instead of working quickly
    - QUIC does not have this problem as it knows what connection it is connecting to

### connection reestablishment stuff
- only needs to reestablish connection if it is lost
- can WebTransport switch from datagrams to streams without having to reconnect?

### user eval plans
- done

### qlog, qvis
- https://qvis.quictools.info/#/files
- turn it on on client and server and give it JSON file

## Plan for next week
- keep going with tests
- redo intro, start background research, put aims in analysis section
