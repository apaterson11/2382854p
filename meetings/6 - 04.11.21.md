## Agenda
- Timeline
- Build
    - Handlers

## Notes
### Timeline
- End of semester 1 all code
- Mid february - quantitative data studies
- End of February - user studies
- Dissertation start - Late February/Early March
- Deadline: 25th March (ish)

### WebRTC Cli/Serv
- If you put one of the peers on the server, then it just works

### Build
- Is Python gonna be good enough/fast enough? C/Rust faster
- Might be worth benchmarking the python implementation
    - Probability delivers packets fine at low quality and rate
    - Independent variables: dummy packets being sent at particular speed increasing, video resolution, frame rate
        - slowly increasing sending rate
        - lower video resolution or frame rate will reduce bits being sent

### WebTransport IETF meeting
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda/
    - Tuesday at noon
    - search for IETF channel on youtube, there will be recording of session 24 hours after

## Plan for next two weeks
- Try and get it running in the first place well, streams and datagrams
- Watch IETF youtube video
- Benchmarking Python implementation is a good idea
- Try and get script running with quiche server  
    - If we get write HTTP library on top of QUIC in rust, shouldn't be too bad
    - Port over the python code for WebTransport stuff into Rust in Quiche
