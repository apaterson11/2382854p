# Meeting 12 - 26.01.22

## Agenda
- What I've been doing: learning mininet, setting up VM, fixed those port issues, messing about doing the wrong thing (port forwarding, bridging) 

### User seeing themselves or should I pump a prerecorded video of me over
- Or should I actually set up me on webcam on the other side 
    - Is this possible on MiniNet?
    - Doesn't matter but run it all on the same machine
    - Prerecorded video would be good for consistency but might not be important
    - Whatever it is, needs to be the same for all builds

### Ethics forms for surveys on people
- What do I do lol
- When does it need done?
- Look into this on moodle
    - Should be easy enough to get approved

### Background reading for diss
- What exactly do I focus on here
    - Talk about WebTransport, its goals, why it's different
    - Talk about WebRTC, its goals, how it has done well but where it might be phased out
    - Talk about how QUIC delivers differently to UDP/TCP
    - Small amount about video - frames etc (don't need that much detail about video compression etc, no need for IPv5 etc.)
    - Existing technologies - Duo
    - Write it as if I am giving it to another student who has not done this project and may not have background networking knowledge

### How do I justify this as a research project instead of a software based project?
- Because I have built some software and I am now evaluating it
- Is there any specific way I can distinguish it from a software project?
- I don't want it to be a software project because the software is not very good
- All depends on how I frame it
    - In this case I have an experimental and unfinished standard and I am trying to see if it works and is useful 
    - Standard is changing, implementations are changing etc

# JS code bottlenecking on MiniNet 
- Should I run evaluations on my host machine too to test client 
- Analyse CPU usage in VM

## Plan for next week
- Have some sort of basic mininet / webtransport test going
- Update all those diagrams to be better hopefully 
- Ethics stuff
