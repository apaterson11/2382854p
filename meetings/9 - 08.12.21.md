# 08/12/21

## Agenda
- Apologies for missing last meeting
    - Two team projects that did not run smoothly and society involvement 
- Missing week 13 - will still get mini report in
- Data finally getting sent to correct stream
    - Questions about streams vs datagrams though
- Plan for the holidays
- Missing week 1 of sem 2

### Stream stuff
- Current issue is that data seems to come in unordered quite frequently
    - Scrambled stream id causes tons of viewports to be generated.
    - This is odd - would expect the opposite. Datagrams on the other hand seem to be quite reliable and ordered.
    - Why is this?
    - Streams are reliable and ordered within their own streams but not between streams
        - Maintains relative order within streams but stream 1 may arrive before stream 2 
    - Datagrams would not mangle the data but may well vanish
        - Contents of datagram will either all arrive or none of it
        - Might arrive more than once - this is quite forgiving for video but unforgiving for audio 

### Plan for the holidays
- Lit review on the coach on the ski trip
    - Remind Colin I will not be present first week of the semester
- Should I prioritise getting a C/Rust server running or implementing text chat or getting audio data sent as well?
- Benchmarking
    - What exact variables do I need
        - Independent variables: dummy packets being sent at particular speed increasing, video resolution, frame rate
            - slowly increasing sending rate
            - lower video resolution or frame rate will reduce bits being sent
        - Send across the bible and see how it handles that?

## Plan for the Christmas break
- Get Colin my semester 2 timetable
- Same plan as last:
    - Try and get it running in the first place well, streams 
    - Watch IETF youtube video
    - Benchmarking Python implementation
    - Try and get script running with quiche server  
        - If we get write HTTP library on top of QUIC in rust, shouldn't be too bad
        - Port over the python code for WebTransport stuff into Rust in Quiche
        - If porting to C is too difficult, would it be more beneficial to run the tests on python or C?
        - Might just be useful as sending different ways of sending data but not benefical to use as a video chatting tool.
