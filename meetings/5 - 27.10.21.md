# 27/10/21

## Agenda
- Analysis and requirements draft
- Is this a research project or a software project?
    - Overall goal is research so probably that?
- Struggling to establish connection with handshake

## Notes
### Analysis and requirements draft
- Should write these drafts in Latex in future
- Talks a fair amount about performance differences
    - Should talk a fair amount about differences in how easy it was to implement
    - Fundamentally hard or just hard because libraries we are building on is hard?
    - If we tried to build WebRTC system years ago, it would be terrible experience because shit documentation, hard APIs etc
        - Is WebTransport going that way or is it always going to be harder because it has to expose more info etc.
        - Generality/complexity trade off - WebRTC does one thing quite well, will WebTransport be harder because it does a lot of things better?
        - Quite subjective as I am the lone developer but plenty scope to talk about in diss.
- Not worth doing a survey about Duo/Zoom etc.
- Should implement a timeline about development
    - Is it realistic to implement 4/5 builds? Need 2 at the very least

### Handshake issues
- Server should get HTTP request
- Look into logging what the server gets

## Plan for next week
- Continue trying to get handshake to work
- Create timeline
