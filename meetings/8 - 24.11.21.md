# 25/11/21

## Agenda
- Size of video data being sent
    - Can benchmark with this too - probably python speed related issues that causes larger video datagrams to not be sent
- Endianness issues resolved
- Missing week 13 - an issue? Was planning on working in week 14/16 anyway
    - Mini report still due for then I think
- Headers issues
- Probably patching the webrtc cli/serv build

### Benchmarking 
- Send over text data to benchmark the webtransport/python implementation too
    - Very large text document - the Bible?

### Week 13
- Missing is not an issue - still need to send over report but that is fine. 
- Will work the hours during the holidays instead. 

### Headers issues
- Expected - aioquic not designed to work with webtransport. Will need to find a way to bridge the two. 
- Should just be a matter of time hopefully.

### WebRTC Cli/Serv
- Would be handy to have for discussion
- Shouldn't be too hard - just a case of putting the other "peer" in the server.
- Will do if I have time, but not high priority 


## Plan for next week
- Same plan as last:
    - Try and get it running in the first place well, streams 
    - Watch IETF youtube video
    - Benchmarking Python implementation
    - Try and get script running with quiche server  
        - If we get write HTTP library on top of QUIC in rust, shouldn't be too bad
        - Port over the python code for WebTransport stuff into Rust in Quiche
