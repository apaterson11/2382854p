# Meeting 19 - 16.03.22

### diss draft
- design
    - bullet points need to be turned into prose 
    - bit vague - need to turn "strengthen goals and achieve aims" into specifics
    - need high level overview for webtransport
        - hard to follow differences and how bits together 
        - restructure
        - add diagrams and code snippets
            - diagrams might be very effective here
            - maybe even datagrams dashed line, streams solid line 
- implementation
    - same issue: lack of diagrams, hard to follow
    - big picture gets a bit lost in the details
        - need to make it clearer how all pieces fit together and how they relate to overall goals
    - keep in server bit that i thought i should take out
    - explain why we are sending at 10fps, 1004 bytes
        - need to give rationale for these "magic" numbers just appearing out of nowhere
        - if it is an arbitrary value, just say that
    - make sure listings and figures are done by figure number
