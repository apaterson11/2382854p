# Meeting 14 - 09.02.22

### tcpdump
- do tcpdump -n to turn off DNS lookups because that will be super slow
- get tcpdump to print out headers and decode them after that
- lib.pcap
    - we can use that to drop into lib.pcap and then drop back into python script

### background reading
- Don't need 40-50 papers for background reading
- Aim for 10-20
