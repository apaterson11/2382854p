# 06/10/21

## Agenda
- Not much to talk about next week
- Talk about what I've done:
    - Plenty reading
    - Experimented with aioquic
    - Briefly looked into ns3

## Notes
### quic implementations
- aioquic is not great, maybe use:
    - Rust
    - Look at C ones
    - QUIC GO (google one) (might be most complete)
    - Cloudflare? Quiche? Worth looking at this one too but that is a Rust one

### RFC9000
- Watch tutorial first from workshop then skim read RFC 9000

### NS3
- Was popular as well as ns2
- If i want to really detailed network sims and i like python then itâ€™s not a terrible choice
- Big and complicated

### Three approaches to testing network protocols:
- Total simulation 
    - ns3 best for this without paying thousands
- Build a testbed
    - Get bunch of machines, wire together, run traffic over internet, measure what happens
    - Hard to build corner cases, can only test internet connection we have
- Emulation
    - MiniNet
    - Docker is a way of running a bunch of containers on linux
    - Mininet uses same container stuff but wires together using linux traffic control to give  network
        - Gives us emulated network to run apps on that
        - Adds delays and constriction to make it seem like a WAN

### Interactive video vs streaming video project
- Not too much interactive stuff over QUIC currently
- WebTransport would let me build a real time QUIC implementation in JavaScript
    - Mini zoom clone
    - How to optimise it
    - Turn into something more full featured
    - Maybe then evaluate how well it works sending video - latency, quality, frames stall
    - HCI - how nice is the interface to use, user trials
    - Could use mininet to make testbed on
    - However if I choose to look at streaming instead then there is lots to work from


### General
- Have a look at Web Transport
    - https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/etGPRo7X4vMBTVHFF1D81y95O4c/

## Plan for next week
- Look into web transport
    - Potentially build prototype zoom clone
- Look into mininet
    - If zoom stuff fails
- Skim some of RFC 9000
    - ~2 hours
- Abandon ns3
- Look into quic implementations other than aioquic
