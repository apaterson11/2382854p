# Meeting 11 - 19.01.22

## Agenda
- What I've been doing: learning mininet, setting up VM

### Topology
- What should the topology of the test network be like?
    - 3 hosts? Is it that simple?
    - V shape with server at the point of the V
    - Don't really want two hosts with link to server
        - Want to put a switch in between the clients and the server so we can control congestion and delay etc
    - Dumbbell topology - not quite what I want but might be indicative of what we're looking for
        - Might need two dumbbell topology? 

    - If all we have is two clients, switch and server we are testing on essentially perfect network
        - Better to simulate "other people" on the network
        - So run some traffic from client's host to the switch to a different server
        - So maybe just send/download a massive file

    - Reason we have switch in middle instead of dedicated link is because it gets weird with TCP when queues are full at switches
        - One critical parameter with TCP is how long the queue is 
        - e.g. if link with 100ms delay

### Issue with ports
- Server not running because it says ports are already in use
    - Any ideas? Or I'll keep working on it

- Is it binding to the port or just randomly assigned?
    - Might just be missing a bind call?

## Plan for next week
- Some sort of basic plan for the testbed 
- Getting some sort of test with MiniNet running
- Watch IETF youtube video
- Benchmarking Python implementation
- Do some reading
