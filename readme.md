* `ethics/` Ethics forms.
* `dissertation/` Source for my project dissertation.
* `meetings/` Records of the meetings I had during the project.
* `presentation/` My presentation.
* `scripts/` Scripts used to run non-mininet alternate builds (i.e. ones not designed for testing) on local machines.
* `status_report/` The status report submitted in December.
* `testing/` The source code used for testing each build.
* `timelog.rmd` The time log for my project.
