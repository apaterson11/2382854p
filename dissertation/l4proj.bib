We review the needs of low-latency real-time applications and how they have been supported in previous protocols, then propose a minimal set of extensions to QUIC to provide such support. Compared to a raw datagram service, our extensions provide meaningful support for partially reliable and real-time flows, in a backwards compatible manner.},

abstract = {WebRTC has quickly become popular as a video conferencing platform, partly due to the fact that many browsers support it. WebRTC utilizes the Google Congestion Control (GCC) algorithm to provide congestion control for realtime communications over UDP. The performance during a WebRTC call may be influenced by several factors, including the underlyingWebRTC implementation, the device and network characteristics, and the network topology. In this paper, we perform a thorough performance evaluation of WebRTC both in emulated synthetic network conditions as well as in real wired and wireless networks. Our evaluation shows that WebRTC streams have a slightly higher priority than TCP flows when competing with cross traffic. In general, while in several of the considered scenarios WebRTC performed as expected, we observed important cases where there is room for improvement. These include the wireless domain and the newly added support for the video codecs VP9 and H.264 that does not perform as expected.},

abstract = {Within a few years of its introduction, QUIC has gained traction: a significant chunk of traffic is now delivered over QUIC. The networking community is actively engaged in debating the fairness, performance, and applicability of QUIC for various use cases, but these debates are centered around a narrow, common theme: how does the new reliable transport built on top of UDP fare in different scenarios? Evaluation of unreliable delivery in QUIC remains largely unexplored.The option for delivering content unreliably, as in a best-effort model, deserves the QUIC designers' and the QUIC community's attention. We propose extending QUIC to support unreliable streams and discuss a simple use case of video streaming---an application that dominates the overall Internet traffic---that can leverage the unreliable streams and potentially bring immense benefits to network operators and content providers. We demonstrate, using controlled-environment trials, how to combine reliable and unreliable streams to outperform TCP and QUIC in video streaming.},

The advent of HTTP/2 powered by transport protocols such as QUIC provides an excellent opportunity to revisit adaptive bitrate streaming with respect to QoE. QUIC promises improved congestion control, zero-RTT connection establishment and multiplexing logical streams. In this work, we adapt state-of-the-art DASH players with buffer-based and hybrid (rate/buffer-based) quality adaptation logic to use QUIC. Our main focus lies in contrasting the QoE performance of DASH algorithms running on top of QUIC versus TCP in various environments. Interestingly, we find through testbed and Internet measurements that QUIC does not provide a boost to current DASH algorithms but instead a degradation in the chosen quality bitrates.},

QUIC's low-latency, improved congestion control, multiplexing features are promising and may help improve viewer experience in HTTP adaptive streaming applications. To investigate what issues due to running HTTP over TCP can be alleviated by using HTTP over QUIC, we measured QUIC's streaming performance on wireless and cellular networks. Specifically, we examined QUIC's performance during network interface changes due to viewer's mobility and under unstable network conditions. Results show that QUIC starts media streams more quickly, providing a better streaming and seeking experience, in particular, when there is more congestion in the network, and outperforms TCP when the viewer is mobile and switches between the networks.},
